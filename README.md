## Overview

This is my first attempt to recreate a design provided by Frontend Mentor. It was a perfect first project since it didn't require any knowledge about responsive web design (to which i haven't gotten yet). I am very proud of myself for completing the project with my own knowledge and Google (when needed).

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

The most difficult thing to figure out was how to center the container in the middle of a webpage. At first I tried to use position attribute, but as i was trying and failing, i decided to change my approach and use flexbox instead.
